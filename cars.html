    <p>Mclaren P1 GTR</p>
    <p>Without road-car regulations to hold it back, the P1™ GTR pushes everything to the limit. Available only to P1™ owners, production of the track-focused GTR began upon completion of the 375th and final road car. The mid-mounted powerplant has an output of 1,000PS (986bhp) and includes an ERS-style push-to-pass system.</p>
